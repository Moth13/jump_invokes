# Invokes

A rest api to handle users and invokes

## Introduction
This micro service has been developped to show my capacties in the goland development.

It is based on a boilerplate I've done since I coded some RestAPI in the past.

I choose to use gin as HTTP web framework, for its perfomance, easiness and capacities.
For the database part, I choose gorm as it handles easily all databases, very pratical to use.

### Though on the coding
Router class is here as a wrapper, gin can be easily switch to mux if wanted.

Code has been cut in logical directory for convenience 
(all models and struct in models, db code into a db directory).

During its development, I've encountered no specific difficulties. I've started by filling the kanban with the task I've thought, then follow the tasks' order I've set.

In order to be sure all consigns are checked, a complete unit test suite has been added.

The only concern I might have about the exercice is about the POST transaction, as the invoice.ID isn't given when a new invoice is POST, I guess the user of the API has to guess it to pass it to the POST transation endpoint. To help I've added a GET invoices endpoint to get all the registered invoices.

Or maybye invoice.Label should be the same as transaction.reference. It would have been the question I'd asked in the feature ticket before confirmed it and start to work on this feature in a work environment.

## Setup 

### Get the code

Clone code from [https://github.com/Moth13/jump_invokes](https://github.com/Moth13/jump_invokes)

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/Moth13/jump_invokes.git
```

### Kanban

A kanban can be found at [Invokes Kaban](https://github.com/users/Moth13/projects/1/views/1)

### Configuration

```zsh
go mod download
```

## Local usage

### Swagger generation
Swagger documention can be generated using swaggo.
See [swaggo](https://github.com/swaggo/swag) for installation

Note that in docker usage, swagger generation is automatised.

```
swag init -o cmd/invokes/docs -d cmd/invokes,internal -g main.go
```
### Build
Note that the swagger generation is mandatory for the build to work.
```zsh
go build -o invokes -ldflags -s invokes/cmd/invokes
```

if build failed with some missing dependencies despite the `go mod download`: 
```zsh
go get github.com/gin-contrib/cors github.com/gin-gonic/gin github.com/gin-gonic/gin/binding github.com/onrik/gorm-logrus github.com/sirupsen/logrus github.com/snowzach/rotatefilehook github.com/swaggo/files github.com/swaggo/gin-swagger github.com/swaggo/swag github.com/toorop/gin-logrus gopkg.in/yaml.v2 gorm.io/driver/mysql gorm.io/driver/postgres gorm.io/driver/sqlite gorm.io/gorm github.com/stretchr/testify/assert
```


### Configuration file
You can find a configuration file sample and a template into the config directory.
The template file is used by the docker usage during the docker image build.
see [config/invokes.yml.sample](./configs/invokes.yml.sample) for more info


### Launch
You can launch the db given by jump:
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/Freelance-launchpad/backend-interviews.git
cd backend-interviews/database
docker build . -t jump-database
docker run -p 5432:5432 jump-database                   
```
Then launch the service using: 
```zsh
./invokes -conf configs/invokes.yml
```


## Docker usage


### Build

```zsh
docker build -f deployment/Dockerfile -t invokes:0.0.0 .
```

### Run 

### Docker image env variables
The docker image has some env variables to make it configurable
```zsh
DB_ENGINE: postgresql // can be mysql, postgresql
DB_PROTO: postgres:// //postgres://, mysql+pymysql://
DB_USER: login
DB_PASSWD: password
DB_PORT: 5432
DB_OPTS:
DB_NAME: 
DB_HOST: dbserver
LOG_LEVEL: error // loglevel from debug, info, warning, error (warning and error as realease mode)
CAT_CONF: "true" // true to display the config at boot
```

### Docker-Compose
A docker-compose file is available in the deployment directory
```zsh
docker-compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yml up
```
It will launch the db and the service


## Unit testing

You can launch some unit test by:
```zsh
go test -v invokes/internal/...
```

## Swagger

As said, a swagger is integrated. Don't forget to generate it in case of local build.

It will be accessible at `{your_base_url}:{your_port}/docs/index.html`

## Endpoints
Following endpoints are available:
- GET `{your_base_url}:{your_port}/ping`
- GET `{your_base_url}:{your_port}/version`
- GET `{your_base_url}:{your_port}/users`
- GET `{your_base_url}:{your_port}/invoices`
- POST `{your_base_url}:{your_port}/invoice`
- POST `{your_base_url}:{your_port}/transaction`

And the swagger as mentionned earlier.

## To be done

Future development can include some securities tools (JWT token, maybye ory/keto usage on the deployment steps).

Integration into a helm chart and an ansible tool should be done too.
